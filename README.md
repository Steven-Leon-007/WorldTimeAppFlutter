# World Time App

This is a simple app that displays the time of different countries and places around the world. You can select
from a data loaded through API [Check it here](https://worldtimeapi.org/). This app was developed following the
Net Ninja guide and implements some other stuff that I like it and will be really helpful for future projects.

This project is part of my Flutter learning series and will get some updates, like animations and other API
endpoints for make it better, also learning how to handle Flutter projects in Git.
